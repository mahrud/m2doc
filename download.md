#### Building from source [![nightly badge]](https://github.com/Macaulay2/M2/actions/workflows/test_build.yml)

The primary source code repository for Macaulay2 is on [GitHub](https://github.com/Macaulay2/M2).
For introductions to version control see:
- [Git for Macaulay2 Contributors](https://github.com/Macaulay2/M2/wiki/Git-for-Macaulay2-Contributors)
- [Git for Workshop Participants](https://github.com/Macaulay2/M2/wiki/Git-for-Workshop-participants)

See the [install guide] for detailed instructions on how to build Macaulay2 from source.
A quick build using CMake and Ninja involves the following steps:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/Macaulay2/M2.git --branch development
cd M2/M2/BUILD/build
cmake -GNinja -S ../.. -B . -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
ninja build-libraries build-programs
ninja install-packages
ninja M2-emacs
```

A list of common issues involving the CMake build is available on the [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/Macaulay2/M2/wiki/FAQ%3A-CMake-Build-Problems). If you run into a problem not listed there or among the list of issues labeled ["build system"](https://github.com/Macaulay2/M2/labels/build%20system), please open a [new issue](https://github.com/Macaulay2/M2/issues/new) on GitHub.
